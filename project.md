summary: Fortran code for reaction path discovery and analysis.

author_description: Computational chemistry research group at the University of Warwick, working at the intersection of chemistry, physics and computer science. We develop simulation tools which can help us to accurately model chemical dynamics in complex systems containing many-atoms. These simulation approaches are being used to understand chemical reaction dynamics in a wide-range of systems, from hydrogen-bond dynamics in simple anion solvation shells, to reactions taking place on water clusters, to catalytic reactions taking place on surfaces.
