{\itshape nebiter 500} \+:: Number of (CI)N\+EB optimization iterations.

{\itshape cithresh 5d-\/4} \+:: R\+MS force threshold at which climbing-\/image is activated.

{\itshape nebspring 0.\+05} \+:: (CI)N\+EB spring constant in au (Eh/bohr$\ast$$\ast$2)

{\itshape nebstep 10.\+1} \+:: Step-\/size for steepest descent or quickmin (au)

{\itshape idppguess .true.} \+:: performs N\+EB under a Image-\/\+Dependent Pair Potential (I\+D\+PP) starting from a linear interpolation to generate a better initial guess for N\+EB. See Article Smidstrup {\itshape et al} J. Chem. Phys. 140, 214106 (2016)

{\itshape projforcetype 2} \+:: Selects which type of N\+EB projected force to use (1\+: original, 2\+: Henkelman {\itshape et al}, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 9901 (2000), 3\+: Kolsbjerg {\itshape et al} J. Chem. Phys. 145, 94107 (2016) )

{\itshape nebconv 1d-\/3} \+::

{\itshape nebmaxconv 5d-\/3} \+::\hypertarget{_annotated_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Constraints control}\label{_annotated_autotoc_md6}
This block controls the constrained atoms and degrees-\/of-\/freedom in G\+DS calculations and geometry-\/optimization calculations.

The {\itshape dofconstraints} input gives the number of fixed D\+O\+Fs (in this case, 6), with following line in the input file listing the integer-\/values of the fixed D\+O\+FS. Here, counting starts at 1 for the {\itshape x}-\/coordinate of atom 1. The {\itshape z}-\/coordinate of atom 2 has the integer value of 6, and so on... \begin{DoxyVerb} dofconstraints 6
 1 2 3 5 6 9
\end{DoxyVerb}


The {\itshape atomconstraints} has the same format as {\itshape dofconstraints}, but the integers now refer to the number of fixed atoms, and the indices of the fixed atoms. In the following, 1 atom is fixed -\/ atom number 13. \begin{DoxyVerb} atomconstraints 1
 13
\end{DoxyVerb}


Finally, the {\itshape alignedatoms} input allows one to define three atoms which will be used to position and orient any input molecular structure in space. This is very useful when performing N\+EB calculations as it helps remove overall translations and orientations of the molecules in the optimized string. Note that the N\+EB routines will automatically select 3 atoms to position and orient if you don\textquotesingle{}t input anything as {\itshape alignedatoms}. In the following example, atoms 1, 2 and 3 are chosen to define the relative position and orientation. \begin{DoxyVerb} alignedatoms
 1 2 3
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{_annotated_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{P\+E\+S control}\label{_annotated_autotoc_md7}
This block controls potential energy evaluations during G\+DS and N\+EB, and also controls geometry-\/optimization.

{\itshape pesfull .T\+R\+UE.} \+:: If .T\+R\+UE., we perform P\+ES evaluations and geometry optimizations for the full system in one go. If .F\+A\+L\+SE., we separately calculate the energy for each independent molecule.

{\itshape pestype orca} \+:: Defines single-\/point P\+ES evaluation code to use ({\itshape orca}, {\itshape dftb}, {\itshape null} or {\itshape lammps})

{\itshape pesfile orca.\+head} \+:: Defines the inputfile containing the header for pes single-\/point calculation.

{\itshape pesopttype orca} \+:: Defines geometry optimization P\+ES code being used ({\itshape orca}, {\itshape dftb}, {\itshape null}, {\itshape uff})

{\itshape pesoptfile orca.\+min} \+:: Defines the inputfile containing the header for geometry-\/optimization calculation.

{\itshape pesexecutable orca} \+:: Defines the executable to use to for single-\/point P\+ES evaluation (full path or alias)

{\itshape pesoptexecutable orca} \+:: Defines the executable to use to for geometry optimization (full path or alias)\hypertarget{_annotated_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Graph-\/restraint potential control}\label{_annotated_autotoc_md8}
Controls G\+DS simulations.

{\bfseries{movefile moves.\+in}} \+:: Identifies the movefile used to input allowed graph moves.

{\bfseries{gdsspring 0.\+025}} \+:: Inter-\/bead spring constant for G\+RP (Eh/\+Bohr$\ast$$\ast$2)

{\bfseries{gdsrestspring 0.\+1}} \+:: Spring constant for harmonic graph enforcement terms (Eh/\+Bohr$\ast$$\ast$2)

{\bfseries{nbstrength 0.\+02}} \+:: Repulsion strength for non-\/bonded atoms \mbox{[}V = nbstrength $\ast$ exp(-\/r\+\_\+\{ij\}$\ast$$\ast$2 / (2 $\ast$ nbrange$\ast$$\ast$2))\mbox{]}

{\bfseries{nbrange 2.\+0}} \+:: Range parameter for non-\/bonded atoms (see above).

{\bfseries{kradius 0.\+1}} \+:: Spring constant for non-\/interacting molecules in G\+DS simulations.

{\bfseries{ngdsrelax 2000}} \+:: Number of steepest-\/descent optimization steps to minimize graph restraint potential

{\bfseries{gdsdtrelax 0.\+05}} \+:: Step-\/size (au) for steepest-\/descent relaxation above.

{\bfseries{gdsoutfreq 10}} \+:: Information output frequency during G\+DS simulation.

{\bfseries{nebrestrend .F\+A\+L\+SE.}} \+:: Flag indicating weather to apply to it duing the optimization of molecules during G\+DS, if optaftermove is .true. (also used in C\+I\+N\+EB).

{\bfseries{optaftermove .T\+R\+UE.}} \+:: Optimizes every molecule involved in the path formation -\/ if the resulting optimised molecule does not conform to the graph, the proposed path is rejected. If nebrestrend .T\+R\+UE., the graph constraining potential are also included during the optimization, and then switched off during a second, in the hope to find a minima in agreement with the graphs (would recommend to set nebrestrend .T\+R\+UE. for this).

{\bfseries{valencerange}} \+:: Defines the allowed valence ranges of each element as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}valencerange{
C 1 4
O 1 2
H 0 1
Pt 0 3 fz
}
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The fz keyword applies only to frozen atoms, either by being defined in the fixedbonds\{\} input (see below), or by atomcontraints keyword. In the example, only Pt-\/X bonds (X= whatever) which can be formed or broken during the G\+DS calculation are counted into the \textquotesingle{}valence\textquotesingle{}. If a cluster of Pt atoms are not moving during a G\+DS calculation, and they are bonded to each other (to varying degrees), the above keyword will allow for up to 3 more bonds, not counting the Pt-\/\+Pt bonds, to be formed on the Pt atoms.

{\bfseries{reactiveatomtypes}} \+:: Defines which types of elements are allowed to react, as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}reactiveatomtypes{
C
O
H
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries{reactiveatoms}} \+:: Defines which atom numbers are allowed to react. These can be given as an inclusive range ({\itshape range XX YY}), or by individual id number ({\itshape id XX}). \begin{DoxyVerb}reactiveatoms{
range 1 4
id 7
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries{reactivevalence}} \+:: Defines the valence range one element can have with another \begin{DoxyVerb}reactivevalence{
Fe Fe 6 8
    H C 0 1
    H O 0 1
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


In the above, {\itshape Fe} must be bonded between 6 to 8 other Fe atoms to be an acceptable molecule. Similarly, the second line indicates that Hydrogen can only be bonded up to 1 carbon atom.

{\bfseries{fixedbonds}} \+:: Defines fixed bonds, which are not allowed to change during a chemical reaction (although they can vibrate, translate, etc.) \begin{DoxyVerb}fixedbonds{
C O
3 4
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


In the above example, {\itshape all} C-\/O bond orders are fixed at whatever they are in the starting structure. So, if a C-\/O bond is present in the starting structure, it cannot change during the G\+DS simulation. Similarly, the bond between atoms {\itshape 3} and {\itshape 4} is also fixed at the starting structure value.

{\bfseries{essentialmoveatoms}} \+:: Defines a list of atoms of which AT L\+E\+A\+ST O\+NE OF T\+H\+EM M\+U\+ST be included in any possible graph moves. The formatting options are the same as the {\itshape reactiveatoms} block described above, for example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}essentialmoveatoms{
range 1 2
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


In the above example, the atoms in the range 1-\/2 must be included amogst the moves chosen.

{\bfseries{essentialatoms}} \+:: Defines atoms of which AT L\+E\+A\+ST O\+NE OF T\+H\+EM M\+U\+ST be included in molecules that are involved in the reactions. The formatting options are the same as the {\itshape reactiveatoms} block described above, for example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}essentialatoms{
id 5
id 7
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


In the above example, the atoms 5 and 7 must be in any of the molecules that are involved in the reaction (from chemical species image 1 changing to nimage)

{\bfseries{allowedbonds}} \+:: Allows definition of bond-\/number constraints in the structures generated by graph moves. The format is as given in the following example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}allowedbonds{
O O 1
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


Here, the constraint indicates that an oxygen atom cannot be bonded to more than 1 other oxygen atom.

{\bfseries{forbidgraphs}} \+:: This is a logical flag which indicates whether or not to use the forbidden graph pattern file. If .T\+R\+UE., then a G\+DS simulation will not allow any graph-\/patterns to form which are input into the forbidfile defined below. By adding entries to the forbid file, users can force G\+DS to stop generating user-\/defined bonding patterns.

{\bfseries{forbidfile forbid.\+in}} \+:: Identifies the file (here, forbid.\+in) which contains the library of forbidden bonding patterns which are used if forbidgraphs = .T\+R\+UE.\hypertarget{_annotated_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Path-\/finding controls}\label{_annotated_autotoc_md9}

This should be an integer\+: (1) Standard element-\/wise comparison, (2) Eigenvalue comparison, (3) Histogram comparison, (4) Eigenvalue comparison for single molecule. {\itshape You should preferably use either (2) or (4)!}

{\bfseries{minmolcharge}} \+:: Minimum allowed molecular charge (if electron transfer moves are allowed in the movefile).

{\bfseries{maxmolcharge}} \+:: As above, but maximum value.

{\bfseries{nchargemol}} \+:: Maximum number of molecules which can be charged.

{\bfseries{maxstepcharge}} \+:: Maximum number of reation steps which can involve charge changes.

{\bfseries{maxtotalcharge}} \+:: Maximum total charge in a given reaction step.
