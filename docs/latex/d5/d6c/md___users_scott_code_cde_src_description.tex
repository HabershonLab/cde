C\+DE Description \{\#description\}

C\+DE implements graph-\/driven reaction path sampling and associated methods.

C\+DE can perform several types of calculations, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Graph-\/driven sampling (G\+DS) for chemical reactions,
\item Climbing-\/image nudged elastic band calculations for optimization of chemical reaction paths.
\item Optimization of molecules against target properties (in progress)
\end{DoxyItemize}

C\+DE interfaces with several external programs to perform energy evaluations and geometry optimization, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item O\+R\+CA
\item Psi-\/4
\item L\+A\+M\+M\+PS
\item D\+F\+T\+B+
\end{DoxyItemize}
