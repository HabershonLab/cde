Auto\+N\+EB is an alternative to the typical N\+EB algorithm. You can find useful references to the Auto\+Neb method in the {\itshape References} (\#\+References) section of the documentation.

This example is similar to {\itshape Tutorial 2}, with the main distinction being the fact that Auto\+N\+EB is used instead of standard C\+I\+N\+EB. In Auto\+Neb, after an initial N\+EB refinement, one then adds a series of beads into the current reaction-\/string, followed by further localized refinement. This approach iteratively improves the description of the M\+EP, and often leads to smoother reaction profiles.

Because this tutorial is very similar to {\itshape Tutorial 1}, we refer to that page for further details about L\+A\+M\+M\+PS and Reax\+FF. Here, we simply highlight the input file, which is as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}# This input file demonstrates a AUTONEB refinement. We use the Quickmin optimization method here, and lammps plus Reaxff for PES calculations.

As shown above, this calculation is set up to first perform a N\+EB calculation with 7 images. After that, the minimum energy path is further refined by addition of 23 images according to the Auto\+N\+EB algorithm.\hypertarget{autoneb_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysection{Output files}\label{autoneb_autotoc_md31}
Note that, when running Auto\+N\+EB calculations, several additional output files are produced, including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$.energy-\/autoneb, which shows the energy of the reaction profile after each additional Auto\+N\+EB image has been added and refined (Here, the $\ast$ is simply the name of the original input file).
\item $\ast$.energy-\/autoneb-\/end, which gives the energy of the final Auto\+N\+E\+B-\/refined minimum-\/energy path.
\item $\ast$\+\_\+autonebfinal.xyz, which is the xyz structure file for the final refined reaction path after completion of N\+EB and Auto\+N\+EB.
