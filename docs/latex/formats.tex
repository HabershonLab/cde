Some important things to note about structure formats used in C\+DE\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Throughout C\+DE, we generally use simple $\ast$.xyz files as input/output formats.
\item You can use {\itshape openbabel} (\href{http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page}{\texttt{ http\+://openbabel.\+org/wiki/\+Main\+\_\+\+Page}}) to convert from a wide range of files to/from xyz files.
\item A convenient program for creating initial structures in xyz format is {\itshape Avogadro} (\href{https://avogadro.cc}{\texttt{ https\+://avogadro.\+cc}}).
\item The coordinates in an X\+YZ format file in units of Angstroms.
\item If performing N\+EB calculations, the number of snapshots (or configurations) in the xyz file for the full path should be the same as that defined in {\itshape nimage} in the input file.
\item Each xyz frame or file looks like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  2

  C 0.000  0.000 0.0000
  O 1.50   1.670 5.6708
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item The first line contains the number of atoms, the second line is blank (or a comment line) and then there is a list of atoms with their atomic labels and (x,y,z) coordinates in Angstroms.
\item Different frames in an xyz file follow each other immediately, like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  2

  C 0.000  0.000 0.0000
  O 1.50   1.670 5.6708
  2

  C 0.1500  0.2166 0.007
  O 1.56  1.679  5.7098
\end{DoxyVerb}
