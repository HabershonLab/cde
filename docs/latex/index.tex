C\+DE is a set of fortran routines which implement several different calculation types associated with chemical reaction-\/path analysis.

{\itshape This is a legacy version of our reaction discovery code -\/ an updated python version is in progress.}

C\+DE can perform several types of calculations, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Single-\/ended Graph-\/driven sampling for chemical reactions (C\+U\+R\+R\+E\+N\+T\+LY U\+N\+A\+V\+A\+I\+L\+A\+B\+LE),
\item Double-\/ended mechanism searching,
\item Generation of initial approximate M\+E\+Ps connecting user-\/defined reactant and product structures using a variety of methods, including linear interpolation and image-\/dependent pair potential (I\+D\+PP) method.
\item Nudged elastic band calculations for refinement of chemical reaction paths.
\end{DoxyItemize}

C\+DE interfaces with several external programs to perform energy evaluations and geometry optimization, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item O\+R\+CA
\item Psi-\/4
\item L\+A\+M\+M\+PS
\item D\+F\+T\+B+
\item Molpro
\end{DoxyItemize}
