In the two original papers describing our graph-\/driven sampling (G\+DS) method, we used a Hamiltonian formulation to describe the evolution of a reaction-\/path as a dynamic object.

The first paper \href{paper_1.pdf}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{here}}}} describes the initial implementation and application to formaldehyde, as well as initial application to ethene hydroformylation.

The second paper \href{paper_2.pdf}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{here}}}} describes further application of our Hamiltonian-\/driven scheme to sample reactions constructing the kinetic network of ethene hydroformylation. In addition, this paper reports combination with transition-\/state theory and Kinetic Monte Carlo to predict the emergent rate law.

After the initial development of our G\+DS approach, we then modified it to perform double-\/ended reaction-\/path searching. The description of this algorithm can be found \href{paper_3.pdf}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{here}}}}, and further application to hydroformylation can be found \href{paper_4.pdf}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{here}}}}.\hypertarget{md___users_scott_code_cde_theory__theory_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysection{Graph-\/based structure generation}\label{md___users_scott_code_cde_theory__theory_autotoc_md25}
The paper \href{graph_based_structures.pdf}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{here}}}} describes a method for automated generation of molecular structures using the idea of graphs and optimization under the graph-\/restraining potential.
