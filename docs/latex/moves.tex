The move-\/file is used in G\+DS to define which graph-\/moves can be used to generate new reaction-\/path end-\/points during each G\+DS graph-\/change step.

A typical move-\/file (usually called {\itshape moves.\+in}, although can be called anything) looks like this\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}move
natom 2
-
0 1
1 0
-
0 0
0 0
-
labels * *
prob 0.4

move
natom 2
-
0 0
0 0
-
0 1
1 0
-
labels * *
prob 0.4

move
natom 3
-
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
-
0 0 1
0 0 1
1 1 0
-
labels * * *
prob 0.1

move
natom 3
-
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
-
0 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
-
labels * * *
prob 0.1
\end{DoxyVerb}


Each move is defined in a block, which looks like this. \begin{DoxyVerb}move
natom 2
-
0 1
1 0
-
0 0
0 0
-
labels * *
prob 0.4
\end{DoxyVerb}


In the example above, the proposed graphmove involves two atoms; these are randomly selected in the code. The first 2x2 matrix is the required bonding pattern of the two atoms; in this case, the moves requires that the two atoms are bonded ({\itshape i.\+e.} there is a 1, indicating bonding, on the off-\/diagonal element). The second 2x2 matrix indicates the target final graph; in thise case, there is a {\itshape 0} on the off-\/diagonal, indicating that there is no bond between the two atoms in the final structure. Overall, therefore, this is a simple bond-\/breaking reaction.

The {\itshape labels} line indicates the required atom labels for this move; in this case, we have indicated \char`\"{} $\ast$ \char`\"{}, which means that {\bfseries{any}} atom can participate. An alternative would be \begin{DoxyVerb}labels C O
\end{DoxyVerb}


which would imply that only C and O can be involved for this graph move.

The {\itshape prob} value gives the relative probability of this move taking place during a given G\+DS run; not that the probabilities of all moves are all normalised in the code ({\itshape i.\+e.} they are re-\/scaled so that they sum to 1), so they do not have to add to 1 in the movefile.

A second example, this time involving 3 atoms, is as follows\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}move
natom 3
-
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
-
0 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
-
labels * * *
prob 0.1
\end{DoxyVerb}


The above reaction is A-\/\+B-\/C -\/-\/$>$ A-\/C + B.
